# Doxygen Template

This template is meant as a quick way to generate good looking C++ documentation.

To get started with Doxygen read [Doxygen](../Docs/Doxygen.md)

The parameters marked in red (Doxywizard Expert View) should be changed to suit your project (value).

**(The HTML Topic values should not be changed, or Doxygen Awesome may not function correctly anymore!)**
