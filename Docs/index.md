# Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal IT knowledge base/wiki site! This is a collection of information and insights that I've gathered over time as a student and software engineer.

Along the way, I've discovered various tips, tricks, and insights that I think others might find helpful.

This site is a way for me to organize and share this information with anyone who might benefit from it. I hope that you find the content here informative and useful. While I am not a professional IT expert (yet), I do my best to provide accurate and reliable information. Please keep in mind that this site is simply a personal project, and the information presented here may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.

The quality of the wiki pages also varies widely from just a couple of links and bullet points to whole articles.

If you have any suggestions or issues with this knowledge base then please open an issue or a pull request in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/romanroth/KnowledgeBase).
