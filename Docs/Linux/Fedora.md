# Fedora

- Fedora Third Party Repos: https://itsfoss.com/fedora-third-party-repos/  
- NVIDIA proprietary driver install with nvautoinstaller  
       - https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora-now-works-with-fedora-34/13765  
       - https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/t0xic0der/nvidia-auto-installer-for-fedora/
- Using Fedora 30 or later there was an update to the BLS (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/BootLoaderSpecByDefault) so `grub-customizer` will not show the Fedora entries. TODO: How to fix this?
